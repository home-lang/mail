## 1. Email Server Security Best Practices

### 1.1 Critical Security Statistics

**The Threat Landscape:**
- 94% of all malware is delivered through email
- Email-based attacks remain the primary vector for cyber threats in 2025
- Unprotected SMTP servers are compromised within hours of exposure

### 1.2 Authentication Protocols (Mandatory)

#### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
**Purpose**: Prevents email spoofing by specifying authorized mail servers

**Implementation:**
```dns
example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 include:_spf.google.com ~all"
```

**Impact**:
- Up to 70% reduction in messages marked as spam
- Required by Gmail, Yahoo, and Microsoft (2024-2025)

**Best Practices:**
- Use hard fail (-all) for production domains
- Include all authorized sending sources
- Keep records under 255 characters
- Monitor for SPF failures regularly

#### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
**Purpose**: Cryptographic signing to verify message integrity

**Implementation:**
- Generate 2048-bit RSA key pair
- Publish public key in DNS TXT record
- Sign outgoing messages with private key

**Impact**:
- 76% of DKIM-signed emails pass spam filters more easily
- Prevents message tampering in transit

**Best Practices:**
- Rotate keys annually for security
- Use separate keys for different mail streams
- Sign all headers that could be modified
- Monitor DKIM validation failures

#### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)
**Purpose**: Specifies handling of unauthenticated messages and provides reporting

**Implementation Phases:**
```dns
# Phase 1: Monitoring
_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com"

# Phase 2: Quarantine
_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; pct=10; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com"

# Phase 3: Reject
_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Start with p=none for monitoring
- Gradually increase policy strictness
- Review aggregate reports weekly
- Maintain strict alignment (aspf=s, adkim=s)

### 1.3 Transport Security

#### TLS Requirements
**2025 Standards:**
- TLS 1.2 minimum, TLS 1.3 strongly recommended
- Strong cipher suites only (no RC4, DES, or MD5)
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) required
- Certificate from trusted CA

**Port Configuration:**
```
Port 25:  SMTP (STARTTLS opportunistic)
Port 465: SMTPS (implicit TLS, deprecated but still used)
Port 587: Message Submission (STARTTLS required)
Port 993: IMAPS (implicit TLS)
Port 995: POP3S (implicit TLS)
```

#### MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security)
**Purpose**: Enforce TLS for email delivery

**Implementation:**
1. Create policy file at `https://mta-sts.example.com/.well-known/mta-sts.txt`:
```
version: STSv1
mode: enforce
mx: mail.example.com
max_age: 86400
```

2. Publish DNS TXT record:
```dns
_mta-sts.example.com. IN TXT "v=STSv1; id=20250124T000000"
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Enforces TLS 1.2+ between mail servers
- Required by security-conscious organizations

### 1.4 Server Hardening

#### Configuration Baseline
**Use industry standards:**
- CIS Benchmarks for OS-level security
- NIST guidelines for cryptographic standards
- OWASP recommendations for web interfaces

#### Essential Hardening Steps

**1. Access Control:**
```bash
# Limit SMTP relay to authenticated users only
# Disable open relay
# Implement IP-based access controls
# Use fail2ban for brute force protection
```

**2. Service Minimization:**
- Disable unnecessary services
- Remove unused SMTP extensions
- Close unused ports
- Run SMTP service as non-root user

**3. Rate Limiting:**
```
Per-IP limits:     50-100 messages/hour
Per-user limits:   200-500 messages/hour
Connection limits: 10-50 concurrent connections per IP
```

**4. Message Size Limits:**
```
Small deployments:  10-25 MB
Medium deployments: 25-50 MB
Enterprise:         50-100 MB
```

### 1.5 Monitoring and Detection

#### Required Monitoring
- **Authentication failures**: Alert on >10 failures/hour
- **Unusual traffic patterns**: Sudden volume spikes
- **Blacklist status**: Check hourly
- **Certificate expiration**: Alert 30 days before
- **Disk space**: Alert at 80% capacity

#### AI-Driven Threat Detection
**2025 Trend**: Machine learning for:
- Phishing detection
- Business Email Compromise (BEC)
- Anomaly detection in sending patterns
- Zero-day threat identification

**Recommended Tools:**
- Barracuda Sentinel
- Proofpoint Targeted Attack Protection
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- Mimecast Targeted Threat Protection

### 1.6 Compliance Requirements

#### Legal Frameworks
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **CAN-SPAM**: Commercial email requirements
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data security (if applicable)
- **SOC 2**: Security controls for service providers

#### Audit Logging
**Required log retention:**
```
Authentication logs: 90 days minimum
Message headers:     1 year recommended
Full messages:       30-90 days (privacy considerations)
Administrative:      1 year minimum
```

## 2. Modern SMTP Server Architectures

### 2.1 Evolution of Email Infrastructure

**Traditional Monolithic (Pre-2020):**
- Single server handling all functions
- Vertical scaling only
- Single point of failure
- Difficult to maintain and update

**Modern Distributed (2025):**
- Microservices-based architecture
- Horizontal scaling
- High availability
- Independent service updates

### 2.2 Microservices Architecture for Email

#### Core Components

**1. API Gateway**
- Single entry point for all client requests
- Handles authentication, rate limiting, logging
- Routes requests to appropriate services
- Implements cross-cutting concerns

**Architecture:**
```
Client → API Gateway → [Service Discovery] → Microservices
                   ↓
           [Auth Service]
           [Rate Limiter]
           [Logger]
```

**2. Service Decomposition**

**Receive Path:**
```
SMTP Reception Service
    ├── Connection Handler (accepts connections)
    ├── Protocol Handler (SMTP commands)
    ├── Authentication Service (validates credentials)
    └── Anti-Spam Service (filtering)
```

**Processing Path:**
```
Message Processing Service
    ├── Header Parser
    ├── MIME Handler
    ├── Attachment Processor
    └── Content Filter
```

**Storage Path:**
```
Storage Service
    ├── Database Writer
    ├── Object Storage (S3/MinIO)
    ├── Cache Layer (Redis)
    └── Search Indexer (Elasticsearch)
```

**Delivery Path:**
```
Queue Management Service
    ├── Priority Scheduler
    ├── Retry Manager
    └── Dead Letter Queue

Delivery Service
    ├── SMTP Relay
    ├── Connection Pool
    └── DNS Resolver
```

#### Database per Service Pattern

**Principle**: Each microservice owns its database schema

**Benefits:**
- Service independence
- Technology flexibility (polyglot persistence)
- Easier scaling
- Fault isolation

**Implementation:**
```
User Service        → PostgreSQL (relational data)
Message Service     → MongoDB (document storage)
Queue Service       → Redis (high-performance queue)
Search Service      → Elasticsearch (full-text search)
Analytics Service   → ClickHouse (time-series data)
```

### 2.3 Scalability Patterns

#### Horizontal Scaling
**Strategy**: Add more instances rather than bigger servers

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: smtp-receiver
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: smtp-receiver
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 20
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

#### Load Balancing Strategies

**Layer 4 (TCP) Load Balancing:**
```
Client → L4 LB → SMTP Receivers (Round Robin/Least Connections)
```

**Layer 7 (Application) Load Balancing:**
```
Client → L7 LB → Route based on:
                  - Source IP (sticky sessions)
                  - Authentication state
                  - Message size
                  - Priority
```

#### Cache Architecture

**Multi-Layer Caching:**
```
Application Cache (in-memory)
    ↓ miss
Distributed Cache (Redis Cluster)
    ↓ miss
Database
```

**Common Cache Patterns:**
- User credentials: 5-15 minutes TTL
- Configuration: 1-60 minutes TTL
- DNS results: 5-60 minutes TTL
- Rate limit counters: Sliding window

### 2.4 High Availability Design

#### Multi-Region Architecture

**Active-Active Configuration:**
```
Region A (Primary)           Region B (Secondary)
    ├── SMTP Receivers           ├── SMTP Receivers
    ├── Queue Managers           ├── Queue Managers
    ├── Database (Master)        ├── Database (Replica)
    └── Storage (Primary)        └── Storage (Replica)
         ↓
    Global Load Balancer (DNS-based)
         ↓
    Automatic Failover
```

**Failover Strategy:**
- Health checks every 10-30 seconds
- Automatic DNS update on failure
- Cross-region database replication
- Eventual consistency acceptable for most operations

#### Data Replication

**Message Data:**
- Asynchronous replication to secondary regions
- Object storage with versioning
- S3 cross-region replication

**Metadata:**
- Synchronous replication for critical data
- Asynchronous for analytics and logs

### 2.5 Modern Architecture Trends (2025)

#### Cloud-Native Design
- Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Serverless for burst workloads
- Managed services for databases
- Auto-scaling based on metrics

#### Event-Driven Architecture
**Pattern**: Services communicate via events

**Message Flow:**
```
SMTP Receive → Publish "MessageReceived" event
                    ↓
         [Event Bus: Kafka/RabbitMQ]
                    ↓
    ┌────────────┬──────────┬──────────────┐
    ↓            ↓          ↓              ↓
Antispam    Indexer    Analytics    Delivery
```

**Benefits:**
- Loose coupling
- Asynchronous processing
- Easy to add new consumers
- Natural backpressure handling

#### Service Mesh
**Purpose**: Handle service-to-service communication

**Features:**
- Mutual TLS between services
- Traffic management and routing
- Observability (metrics, traces, logs)
- Resilience (retries, timeouts, circuit breakers)

**Popular Options:**
- Istio
- Linkerd
- Consul Connect

## 3. Email Deliverability Optimization

### 3.1 The 2025 Deliverability Landscape

**Major Provider Requirements (Gmail, Yahoo, Microsoft):**
- SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are mandatory (not optional)
- RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe for bulk mail
- Spam complaint rate must stay under 0.3%
- TLS required for message submission

**Target Metrics:**
```
Inbox Rate:           90%+
Spam Rate:            <0.3%
Bounce Rate:          <2%
Complaint Rate:       <0.1%
```

### 3.2 Authentication Setup (Critical Foundation)

#### SPF Implementation

**Step 1: Audit Current Senders**
```bash
# Identify all legitimate sending sources
- Primary mail server IPs
- Marketing platform IPs (Mailchimp, SendGrid, etc.)
- CRM systems
- Automated systems
```

**Step 2: Create Comprehensive SPF Record**
```dns
v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 ip4:198.51.100.0/24
include:_spf.mailprovider.com
include:_spf.marketingtool.com
~all
```

**Step 3: Test and Monitor**
- Use dmarcian or EasyDMARC SPF checker
- Monitor SPF failures in DMARC reports
- Update record as infrastructure changes

#### DKIM Setup

**Step 1: Generate Keys**
```bash
# Generate 2048-bit RSA key
openssl genrsa -out dkim_private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in dkim_private.pem -pubout -out dkim_public.pem
```

**Step 2: Publish DNS Record**
```dns
selector._domainkey.example.com. IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCS..."
```

**Step 3: Configure Signing**
- Sign all outgoing messages
- Include headers: From, To, Subject, Date, Message-ID
- Use consistent selector across infrastructure

#### DMARC Implementation Roadmap

**Week 1-2: Monitor Mode**
```dns
_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com; pct=100"
```
- Collect reports for 2 weeks
- Identify all legitimate senders
- Fix SPF and DKIM issues

**Week 3-4: Quarantine Testing**
```dns
_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; pct=10; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com"
```
- Apply policy to 10% of messages
- Monitor impact
- Gradually increase percentage

**Week 5+: Full Enforcement**
```dns
_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com; ruf=mailto:forensic@example.com"
```

### 3.3 IP and Domain Warmup

#### Why Warmup Matters
- Cold IPs/domains have zero reputation
- Sudden volume spikes trigger spam filters
- ISPs monitor sending patterns
- Warmup builds trust gradually

#### Recommended Warmup Schedule

**New IP Address (4-6 weeks):**
```
Week 1:  50 emails/day    (total: 350)
Week 2:  100 emails/day   (total: 700)
Week 3:  250 emails/day   (total: 1,750)
Week 4:  500 emails/day   (total: 3,500)
Week 5:  1,000 emails/day (total: 7,000)
Week 6:  2,500 emails/day (total: 17,500)
Week 7+: Full volume
```

**New Domain (2-4 weeks):**
```
Week 1:  20 emails/day per mailbox (max 40/day)
Week 2:  40 emails/day per mailbox (max 80/day)
Week 3:  60 emails/day per mailbox (max 120/day)
Week 4+: Normal volume
```

#### Warmup Best Practices

**1. Start with Engaged Users:**
- Send to recipients who previously opened emails
- Use clean, validated email lists
- Avoid cold prospects initially

**2. Maintain Consistent Volume:**
- Send similar amounts daily
- Avoid sporadic bursts
- Schedule sends evenly throughout day

**3. Monitor Metrics Closely:**
```
Daily monitoring:
- Bounce rate (should be <2%)
- Complaint rate (must be <0.1%)
- Open rate (baseline for your audience)
- Click rate (engagement indicator)
```

**4. Use Warmup Tools:**
- MailReach
- Warmup Inbox
- Lemlist Warm-up
- Instantly.ai Warm-up

### 3.4 List Hygiene

#### Email Validation Process

**Pre-Send Validation:**
```
1. Syntax validation (RFC 5322)
2. DNS MX record check
3. SMTP validation (actual mailbox exists)
4. Disposable email detection
5. Role account detection (info@, admin@, etc.)
```

**Recommended Tools:**
- ZeroBounce
- NeverBounce
- BriteVerify
- Kickbox

#### List Maintenance Schedule

**Weekly:**
- Remove hard bounces immediately
- Flag soft bounces after 3 attempts

**Monthly:**
- Remove inactive users (no opens in 6 months)
- Re-validate high-value segments
- Clean temporary email addresses

**Quarterly:**
- Full list validation
- Remove unengaged users (no opens in 12 months)
- Update suppression list

### 3.5 Content Optimization

#### Spam Trigger Words to Avoid
```
Finance:      "Free money", "Cash bonus", "Prize"
Urgency:      "Act now", "Limited time", "Hurry"
Manipulation: "Hidden", "Secret", "Miracle"
```

#### Best Practices

**1. Subject Lines:**
- Keep under 50 characters
- Avoid ALL CAPS
- Personalize when possible
- A/B test regularly

**2. Email Body:**
- Text-to-image ratio: 60:40 minimum
- Include unsubscribe link prominently
- Use proper HTML structure
- Test on multiple clients

**3. Technical Requirements:**
```html
<!-- Required headers -->
From: sender@example.com
Reply-To: reply@example.com
List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:unsub@example.com>
List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click

<!-- Sender information -->
Physical mailing address required (CAN-SPAM)
```

## 4. Efficient Queue Management Strategies

### 4.1 Queue Architecture Fundamentals

#### Multi-Priority Queue System

**Priority Levels:**
```
Priority 1 (Critical):   System alerts, password resets, 2FA
Priority 2 (High):       Transactional emails, receipts, confirmations
Priority 3 (Normal):     User notifications, updates
Priority 4 (Low):        Marketing, newsletters, bulk mail
Priority 5 (Deferred):   Retry queue for failed deliveries
```

**Processing Strategy:**
- Process all Priority 1 messages immediately
- Round-robin between priorities with weighted distribution
- Prevent starvation of lower priorities

#### Queue Structure

**Message Attributes:**
```json
{
  "id": "msg_123456",
  "priority": 2,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-24T10:30:00Z",
  "scheduled_at": "2025-10-24T10:30:00Z",
  "retry_count": 0,
  "max_retries": 5,
  "backoff_strategy": "exponential",
  "recipient": "user@example.com",
  "sender": "noreply@service.com",
  "message_data": {},
  "metadata": {
    "campaign_id": "camp_789",
    "user_id": "user_456"
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Retry Strategies

#### Exponential Backoff Algorithm

**Standard Implementation:**
```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: 5 minutes    (2^1 * base_delay)
Attempt 3: 20 minutes   (2^2 * base_delay)
Attempt 4: 80 minutes   (2^3 * base_delay)
Attempt 5: 320 minutes  (2^4 * base_delay)
Attempt 6: Dead letter queue
```

**With Jitter (Recommended):**
```python
def calculate_backoff(attempt, base_delay=5):
    # Calculate exponential backoff
    delay = base_delay * (2 ** (attempt - 1))

    # Add jitter (±20% randomization)
    jitter = delay * 0.2 * (random.random() - 0.5)

    # Cap maximum delay
    max_delay = 86400  # 24 hours

    return min(delay + jitter, max_delay)
```

**Benefits of Jitter:**
- Prevents thundering herd problem
- Distributes load over time
- Reduces burst retry attempts

#### Adaptive Retry Strategy

**Adjust based on error type:**
```
Temporary failures (4xx):
- Network timeout:        Standard exponential backoff
- Greylisting:            Wait 15-60 minutes
- Rate limiting:          Honor Retry-After header
- Mailbox full:           Long delay (4-24 hours)

Permanent failures (5xx):
- Invalid recipient:      No retry, immediate bounce
- Domain not found:       No retry, immediate bounce
- Message rejected:       No retry, immediate bounce
```

### 4.3 Performance Optimization

#### Batch Processing

**Strategy**: Group similar operations

**Benefits:**
- Reduce overhead (single DB transaction vs. many)
- Better cache utilization
- Improved throughput

**Implementation:**
```
Batch size: 100-1000 messages
Flush interval: 1-10 seconds
Trade-off: Latency vs. throughput
```

#### Connection Pooling

**SMTP Connection Pool:**
```
Min connections: 5
Max connections: 50
Idle timeout: 60 seconds
Max lifetime: 3600 seconds
Connection validation: Test before use
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates connection overhead
- Reuses TLS sessions
- Reduces DNS lookups

#### Rate Limiting

**Per-Destination Limits:**
```
Gmail:      20-30 connections, 100-200 msg/connection
Yahoo:      20-30 connections, 100-200 msg/connection
Outlook:    20-30 connections, 100-200 msg/connection
Other:      10-20 connections, 50-100 msg/connection
```

**Implementation:**
```
Token bucket algorithm:
- Refill rate: X tokens per second
- Bucket capacity: Y tokens
- Cost per message: 1 token
- When bucket empty: Queue message
```

### 4.4 Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

**Purpose**: Handle messages that fail after all retries

**DLQ Processing:**
```
1. Move to DLQ after max retries exceeded
2. Store failure reason and history
3. Alert administrators
4. Manual review and reprocessing
5. Optional: Automatic bounce generation
```

**DLQ Monitoring:**
- Alert when DLQ size exceeds threshold
- Regular review of DLQ contents
- Identify patterns in failures
- Improve handling of common issues

### 4.5 Queue Monitoring

#### Essential Metrics

**Performance Metrics:**
```
- Queue depth (per priority)
- Processing rate (messages/second)
- Average latency
- P95/P99 latency
- Throughput (messages/hour)
```

**Health Metrics:**
```
- Success rate
- Retry rate
- DLQ rate
- Bounce rate
- Processing errors
```

#### Alerting Strategy

**Critical Alerts:**
```
- Queue depth >10,000 messages
- Processing stopped (0 throughput)
- DLQ growing rapidly
- Success rate <90%
```

**Warning Alerts:**
```
- Queue depth >5,000 messages
- P99 latency >5 minutes
- Retry rate >20%
- Success rate <95%
```

### 4.6 Scalability Patterns

#### Horizontal Scaling

**Queue Workers:**
```
Single queue: Multiple workers consume in parallel
Partition queue: Distribute by hash (recipient domain)
Dedicated queues: Separate queue per priority
```

**Scaling Strategy:**
```yaml
min_workers: 3
max_workers: 20
scale_up_threshold: queue_depth > 1000
scale_down_threshold: queue_depth < 100
cooldown_period: 300 seconds
```

#### Queue Sharding

**Shard by domain:**
```
gmail.com    → Queue 1
yahoo.com    → Queue 2
outlook.com  → Queue 3
others       → Queue 4
```

**Benefits:**
- Domain-specific rate limiting
- Isolate problem domains
- Optimize delivery per ISP

## 5. Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategies

### 5.1 Deployment Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Downtime | Complexity | Cost | Rollback Speed | Risk |
|----------|----------|------------|------|----------------|------|
| Rolling Update | None | Low | Low | Medium | Low |
| Blue-Green | None | Medium | High (2x) | Instant | Low |
| Canary | None | High | Medium | Fast | Very Low |

### 5.2 Rolling Updates (Recommended Default)

#### How It Works

**Process:**
```
1. Deploy new version to subset of instances
2. Wait for health checks to pass
3. Route traffic to new instances
4. Repeat for remaining instances
5. Complete when all instances updated
```

**Kubernetes Implementation:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: smtp-server
spec:
  replicas: 6
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 2        # Max 2 new pods above desired count
      maxUnavailable: 1  # Max 1 pod unavailable during update
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: smtp-server
        image: smtp-server:v2.0.0
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 5
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
```

#### Advantages
- Simple to implement
- Cost-effective (no additional infrastructure)
- Gradual rollout reduces blast radius
- Built into Kubernetes

#### Disadvantages
- Slower than blue-green
- Mixed versions running temporarily
- Complex rollback if issues discovered late

### 5.3 Blue-Green Deployment

#### How It Works

**Architecture:**
```
Production (Blue):     smtp-server:v1.0.0
Staging (Green):       smtp-server:v2.0.0

Step 1: Deploy v2.0.0 to Green environment
Step 2: Test Green thoroughly
Step 3: Switch load balancer from Blue to Green
Step 4: Monitor Green for issues
Step 5: Keep Blue running for instant rollback
```

**Implementation with Kubernetes:**
```yaml
# Blue deployment (current production)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: smtp-server-blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: smtp-server
      version: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: smtp-server
        version: blue
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: smtp-server
        image: smtp-server:v1.0.0

---
# Green deployment (new version)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: smtp-server-green
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: smtp-server
      version: green
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: smtp-server
        version: green
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: smtp-server
        image: smtp-server:v2.0.0

---
# Service that switches between blue and green
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: smtp-server
spec:
  selector:
    app: smtp-server
    version: blue  # Change to "green" to switch
  ports:
  - port: 25
    targetPort: 25
```

#### Advantages
- Instant switchover
- Instant rollback (just switch back)
- Full testing before production traffic
- Clean separation of old and new

#### Disadvantages
- Doubles infrastructure costs temporarily
- Database migrations can be complex
- Stateful services require careful handling

### 5.4 Canary Deployment (Recommended for Critical Systems)

#### How It Works

**Progressive Traffic Shifting:**
```
Phase 1:  5% traffic → Canary (v2.0.0)
          95% traffic → Stable (v1.0.0)
          Monitor for 15-30 minutes

Phase 2:  25% traffic → Canary
          75% traffic → Stable
          Monitor for 30-60 minutes

Phase 3:  50% traffic → Canary
          50% traffic → Stable
          Monitor for 1-2 hours

Phase 4:  100% traffic → Canary
          0% traffic → Stable
          Keep stable for 24 hours before removing
```

**Kubernetes with Istio:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: smtp-server
spec:
  hosts:
  - smtp-server
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        canary:
          exact: "true"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: smtp-server
        subset: canary
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: smtp-server
        subset: stable
      weight: 95
    - destination:
        host: smtp-server
        subset: canary
      weight: 5
```

#### Monitoring During Canary

**Key Metrics:**
```
Error rate comparison:
  Stable: 0.5%
  Canary: 0.6%  ← Within acceptable range

Latency comparison (P99):
  Stable: 200ms
  Canary: 195ms  ← Acceptable

Resource usage:
  Stable: 40% CPU, 60% Memory
  Canary: 42% CPU, 62% Memory  ← Acceptable
```

**Automatic Rollback Conditions:**
```
- Error rate >2x baseline
- Latency >1.5x baseline
- Memory leak detected
- CPU spike >80%
```

#### Advantages
- Minimal blast radius (only affects small percentage)
- Real production traffic testing
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
- Automatic rollback possible

#### Disadvantages
- Complex setup (requires service mesh or advanced LB)
- Requires sophisticated monitoring
- Slower full deployment
- Mixed version coordination needed

### 5.5 Database Migration Strategies

#### Backward-Compatible Changes

**Expand-Contract Pattern:**
```
Phase 1 (Expand):
  - Add new column (nullable)
  - Write to both old and new columns
  - Deploy application v2

Phase 2 (Migrate):
  - Backfill data in new column
  - Verify data consistency

Phase 3 (Contract):
  - Update application to only use new column
  - Deploy application v3
  - Drop old column
```

**Example:**
```sql
-- Phase 1: Add new column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Application v2 writes to both email_confirmed and email_verified

-- Phase 2: Backfill
UPDATE users SET email_verified = email_confirmed WHERE email_verified IS NULL;

-- Phase 3: Drop old column (after v3 deployed)
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN email_confirmed;
```

#### Zero-Downtime Schema Changes

**Best Practices:**
- Never drop columns immediately
- Add columns as nullable first
- Use triggers for data migration
- Test rollback procedures
- Have database backups

### 5.6 Session/State Management

**Sticky Sessions:**
```
Use session affinity for:
- SMTP connections in progress
- Admin panel logged-in users
- WebSocket connections
```

**Graceful Shutdown:**
```go
// Pseudocode for graceful shutdown
func shutdown(server) {
    // 1. Stop accepting new connections
    server.stopAccept()

    // 2. Wait for active connections to complete
    timeout := 30 * time.Second
    server.waitForConnections(timeout)

    // 3. Force close remaining connections
    server.forceClose()

    // 4. Flush queue to disk
    queue.flush()

    // 5. Exit
}
```

## 6. Email Reputation Management

### 6.1 Understanding Reputation Systems

#### Two Types of Reputation

**IP Address Reputation:**
- Tied to sending IP addresses
- Shared if using shared hosting
- Takes 4-6 weeks to build
- Can recover in 2-4 weeks

**Domain Reputation:**
- Tied to sending domain
- Independent of IP address
- Takes longer to build (2-3 months)
- Harder to recover if damaged
- **More important in 2025+**

### 6.2 Building Strong Reputation

#### Initial Setup (Week 1)

**1. Technical Configuration:**
```
☑ SPF record published
☑ DKIM keys generated and signing
☑ DMARC policy set to p=none

☑ Reverse DNS (PTR) configured
```

**2. List Preparation:**
```
☑ Validated all email addresses
☑ Removed bounces and complainers
☑ Segmented by engagement level
☑ Obtained proper consent
☑ Unsubscribe mechanism working
```

**3. Infrastructure:**
```
☑ Dedicated IP addresses (if volume >50k/month)
☑ Proper bounce handling configured
☑ Feedback loop registration (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
