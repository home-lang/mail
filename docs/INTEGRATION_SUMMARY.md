# zig-bump Integration Summary

This document summarizes the integration of zig-bump into the SMTP server project for automated version management and releases.

## What Was Integrated

### 1. Build System Integration

**Files Modified:**
- `build.zig.zon` - Added zig-bump as a build dependency
- `build.zig` - Added bump executable installation step

The bump tool is now built and installed automatically when you run `zig build`.

**Location:** `/path/to/smtp-server/zig-out/bin/bump`

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows

**New Workflow: `.github/workflows/version.yml`**
- Manual version bumping via GitHub UI
- Supports patch, minor, and major releases
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Automatically pushes version tags

**Updated Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`**
- Enhanced release notes extraction from CHANGELOG.md
- Better version handling
- Docker image tagging with version numbers
- Professional release notes template

### 3. Scripts

**New Script: `scripts/bump-version.sh`**
- Helper script for local version bumping
- Checks for uncommitted changes
- Auto-installs zig-bump if needed
- User-friendly output with color coding

**New Script: `scripts/test-version-bump.sh`**
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Validates all components are properly set up
- Provides helpful diagnostic information

### 4. Makefile Targets

Added the following convenient targets:

```makefile
make install          # Install zig-bump tool
make bump-patch       # Bump patch version
make bump-minor       # Bump minor version
make bump-major       # Bump major version
make bump-interactive # Interactive version selection
make release-patch    # Bump patch and trigger release
make release-minor    # Bump minor and trigger release
make release-major    # Bump major and trigger release
```

### 5. Documentation

**New Documentation:**
- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` - Comprehensive release guide
- `docs/INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file
- Updated `README.md` with release process section

## How It Works

### The Version Bump Flow

```
Developer runs: make release-patch
         ↓
scripts/bump-version.sh executes
         ↓
zig-bump updates build.zig.zon (0.0.0 → 0.0.1)
         ↓
git commit created: "chore: release v0.0.1"
         ↓
git tag created: "v0.0.1"
         ↓
Push to GitHub (commit + tag)
         ↓
GitHub detects tag matching "v*.*.*"
         ↓
.github/workflows/release.yml triggers
         ↓
Build binaries (Linux, macOS x86_64/ARM64)
         ↓
Build and push Docker image
         ↓
Create GitHub Release with:
  - Binary artifacts
  - Release notes from CHANGELOG.md
  - Docker installation instructions
```

### Component Integration

1. **zig-bump** (~/Code/zig-bump)
   - Standalone tool for version management
   - Handles git operations (commit, tag, push)
   - Supports dry-run mode for testing

2. **Build System** (build.zig, build.zig.zon)
   - Declares zig-bump as dependency
   - Builds and installs bump binary
   - Integrates into project build

3. **Scripts** (scripts/*.sh)
   - Wrapper around zig-bump
   - Validation and safety checks
   - User-friendly interface

4. **GitHub Actions** (.github/workflows/*.yml)
   - Automated release pipeline
   - Multi-platform builds
   - Docker image publishing

5. **Makefile**
   - Unified interface
   - Simple commands for common tasks
   - Hides complexity

## Usage Examples

### Quick Release

```bash
# Bug fix release
make release-patch

# New feature release
make release-minor

# Breaking change release
make release-major
```

### Manual Control

```bash
# Bump version locally without pushing
./zig-out/bin/bump patch --no-push

# Preview what would happen
./zig-out/bin/bump minor --dry-run

# Custom tag name
./zig-out/bin/bump patch --tag-name "release-1.0.0"
```

### GitHub UI

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Version Management" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose release type
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Testing the Integration

Run the integration test suite:

```bash
./scripts/test-version-bump.sh
```

This validates:
- ✓ build.zig.zon exists and has bump dependency
- ✓ zig-bump is installed
- ✓ GitHub workflows are configured
- ✓ Scripts are executable
- ✓ Makefile targets exist
- ✓ Documentation is present
- ✓ Dry-run mode works

## Files Added/Modified

### Added Files
- `.github/workflows/version.yml` - Version management workflow
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` - Version bump helper script
- `scripts/test-version-bump.sh` - Integration test script
- `Makefile` - Build and release automation
- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` - Release process documentation
- `docs/INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files
- `build.zig.zon` - Added bump dependency
- `build.zig` - Added bump executable installation
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Enhanced release workflow
- `README.md` - Added release process section

## Configuration

### zig-bump Location

The integration expects zig-bump to be located at:
```
~/Code/zig-bump
```

If your zig-bump is in a different location, update:
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` (ZIG_BUMP_DIR variable)
- `.github/workflows/version.yml` (build step path)

### GitHub Secrets Required

For the release workflow to work, ensure these secrets are set:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Docker Hub username (for Docker image publishing)
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Docker Hub access token (for Docker image publishing)

## Best Practices

1. **Always update CHANGELOG.md before releasing**
   - Helps generate better release notes
   - Provides context for users

2. **Test with dry-run first**
   ```bash
   ./zig-out/bin/bump patch --dry-run
   ```

3. **Use semantic versioning**
   - patch: Bug fixes (0.0.1 → 0.0.2)
   - minor: New features (0.0.1 → 0.1.0)
   - major: Breaking changes (0.0.1 → 1.0.0)

4. **Keep commits clean before releasing**
   ```bash
   git status  # Ensure no uncommitted changes
   ```

5. **Monitor the release workflow**
   - Check GitHub Actions after pushing tag
   - Verify binaries are built successfully
   - Test Docker image

## Troubleshooting

### "zig-bump not found"
```bash
make install
```

### "Permission denied" on scripts
```bash
chmod +x scripts/bump-version.sh
chmod +x scripts/test-version-bump.sh
```

### Build fails with bump dependency
```bash
# Ensure zig-bump exists
ls ~/Code/zig-bump

# If not, clone it
cd ~/Code
git clone https://github.com/stacksjs/zig-bump.git
cd zig-bump
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

### Release workflow doesn't trigger
- Ensure tag follows pattern `v*.*.*` (e.g., v0.0.1)
- Check GitHub Actions is enabled for the repository
- Verify you have push permissions

### Docker image not published
- Check DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD secrets are set
- Verify Docker Hub credentials are valid
- Check workflow logs for authentication errors

## Maintenance

### Updating zig-bump

```bash
cd ~/Code/zig-bump
git pull origin main
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

Then rebuild the SMTP server:
```bash
cd /path/to/smtp-server
zig build
```

### Updating Workflows

GitHub Actions workflows are automatically kept up-to-date with the latest GitHub Actions versions. Monitor for:
- Deprecation warnings in workflow runs
- Security advisories for actions
- New features in zig-bump

   make release-patch  # Creates v0.0.1
   ```

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md**
   - Add release notes for future versions
   - Follow Keep a Changelog format

3. **Configure Docker Hub**
   - Add DOCKER_USERNAME secret
